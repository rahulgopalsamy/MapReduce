The following Project was done in MapReduce to analyse the classroom utilization in Univeristy at Buffalo.

Problem Q1TwoSatgeMr, Q2 and Q3 are done with two stage MapReduce. The corresponding output files for the problem can be seen in Q1_output, Q2_output, Q3_output.

A report on our approach for MapReduce Problems can be seen in Project.pdf

The output from the MapReduce were latter analysed using Tableau software. Stories and Dashboards were created. -> see project3.twbx
